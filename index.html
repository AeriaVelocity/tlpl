  <p>Or don't. After all, you can do whatever, right?</p>
  <h3>Pretty crappy web page, huh?</h3>
  <p><a href="https://that1m8head.github.io/Website-Simplicity/">You don't need a fancy web page to make a point.</a></p>
  
  <h3>I prefer Markdown documents over text files, is there a LICENSE.md version?</h3>
  <p>No need, just download the license and change '.txt' to '.md'.<br>You can add whatever Markdown formatting you like as long as you don't change any content in the license document.</p>
  
  <h3>Why did you make the <a href="/tlpl/404">404 page</a> a Blue Screen of Death?</h3>
  <p>Because I wanted to.</p>
  
  <h3>And what if someone thinks the BSOD's real?</h3>
  <p>Then they're pretty flipping stupid.</p>

  <h3>Cool buttons.</h3>
  <p>They aren't mine -- credit goes to the <a href="http://buttons.github.io">GitHub Buttons project</a>.</p>
