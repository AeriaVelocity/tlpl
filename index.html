	<p>Copy the above license document into a LICENSE file and add it to your code or with any binaries.</p>
	<p>Or just click the download button and add that file to your code.</p>
	<p>If you want to, put this disclaimer in your software somewhere:</p>

	<p>The latest version of the TLPL is recommended, though I won't stop you from using versions 2 or 1.</p>
	<p>It's important to note that the TLPL is not an official license, and is intended for use with works that probably don't need to be protected under copyleft. If software freedom is your goal, and you care quite a bit about your program, you should not use the TLPL, and use something like the GNU GPL instead.</p>

	<p>The general idea behind the TLPL was inspired by <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL</a>.</p>
