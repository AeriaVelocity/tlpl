# Take it and Like it Public Licence
TLPL is a permissive software licence. It allows people to take your code and go off and do whatever with it, with zero repercussions on you.

The document uses a mix of "license" and "licence" because the UK decided to spell it slightly differently.

It's recommended you use Version 2, but Version 1 is still available for use.
## Version 2
